    Compute the digital roots of all numbers starting from start
    to end (both inclusive), and group the numbers in this range
    based on their digital root.

    For example, the resulting dictionary will map the digit 3 to
    the list of numbers in the input range whose digital root is 3.
    The numbers in each list should appear in increasing order.

    Inputs:
      start: An int
      end: An int

    Returns: A dictionary mapping each digit i to the list of
    numbers in the input range whose digital root is i.
